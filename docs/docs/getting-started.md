# Getting Started

Wonderplate is a simple CLI tool to drop some very basic scaffolding for a shopify theme. It intends to be minimal and easy to extend. We do not provide a theme but a set of tools to help you build your own.

## Installation

Run the CLI command and follow the prompts.

```bash
npm create @wondercraft/wonderplate-shopify@latest
```

## Generate a new component

To generate a new component run the following command:

```bash
npm run generate
```
